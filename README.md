# Vanishing Gradient Problem Solutions

This repository provides a comprehensive exploration of solutions to the **Vanishing Gradient Problem** in Deep Learning. The vanishing gradient issue is a significant challenge in training deep neural networks, often leading to slow or stalled learning. To address this, the project implements seven optimizations aimed at mitigating the issue and improving the overall performance of deep learning models.

## Optimizations Implemented

1. **Increasing Weights**: Adjusting initial weights to reduce the effect of vanishing gradients during backpropagation.
2. **Changing Activation Function (ReLU)**: Replacing traditional activation functions (e.g., sigmoid, tanh) with ReLU to avoid gradient saturation.
3. **Changing Optimizer (Adam)**: Using adaptive optimizers like Adam for better gradient updates.
4. **Batch Normalization**: Normalizing intermediate layer outputs to stabilize training and mitigate vanishing gradients.
5. **Skip-Connection**: Incorporating residual connections to allow gradients to flow directly to earlier layers.
6. **Fine-Tuning**: Incrementally improving model parameters to achieve optimal performance.
7. **Gradient Normalization**: Scaling gradients to prevent them from becoming too small or too large.
